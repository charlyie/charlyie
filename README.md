### 👋 Hello, I'm Charles Bourgeaux

I'm a engineering manager who is passionate in API, Open source projects, and using low-impact technologies 🌱
Some technologies I'm working with are PHP (mainly), Bash, Linux, JS, Amazon AWS (not that *low-impact*...).

I created in 2016 the [reSmush.it API](https://resmush.it) to bring optimized pictures to developers, and for free :) 
Now, this service is the biggest FREE API in Image Optimization (with more than **10 billion images optimized**). It's optimizing **15 million pictures** daily, and I'm working hard to provide a strong reliability 💪

I am also working as CTO for the [French Intranet solution Inside](https://www.intranet-inside.com/).🇫🇷 



#### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

💡 &nbsp;I like to test new technologies and find new ways to lower my ecological impact.

⚙️ &nbsp;I'm fond of automatization, simplifications for final users, and I use Pipelines, CI and CD

🎓 I studied in Dublin City University, Ireland, and I have a Masters degree in Telecommunications. 

🌱 I work a lot in my vegetable garden

✍️ I'm quite addicted to [Notion.so](https://notion.so)

🏃‍♂️&nbsp;In my free time, I'm developing apps, running, riding and play the piano.
