### 👋  &nbsp; Hello, I'm Charles Bourgeaux

I'm a CTO who is passionate in API, Open source projects, and using low-impact technologies 🌱

Some technologies I'm working with are PHP (mainly), Python, Amazon AWS (not that *low-impact*...), Bash, Linux (Sysadmin), Github Actions.

I created in 2015 the [reSmush.it API](https://resmush.it) to bring optimized pictures to developers, and for free :) 
Now, this service is the biggest FREE API in Image Optimization (with more than **25 billion images optimized**). It's optimizing **15 million pictures** daily, and I'm working hard to provide a strong reliability 💪

I worked during 5 years as CTO for the [French Intranet solution Inside](https://www.intranet-inside.com/).🇫🇷 

I'm currently working as CTO since June 2022 at [medici.tv](https://www.medici.tv/) which is the Netflix of Classical Music. 🎵



#### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; About Me

💡 &nbsp; I like to test new technologies and find new ways to lower my ecological impact.

⚙️ &nbsp; I'm fond of automatization, simplifications for final users, and I use Pipelines, CI and CD

👩 &nbsp; I work also as a DPO, and GDPR has few secrets to me :)

🎓 &nbsp; I studied in [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie), Ireland, and I graduated a Masters degree in Telecommunications. 

🌱 &nbsp; I work a lot in my vegetable garden

✍️ &nbsp; I'm quite addicted to [Notion.so](https://notion.so) 😍

🏃‍♂️&nbsp; In my free time, I'm developing apps, running, beekeeping, riding bike and play the piano.
